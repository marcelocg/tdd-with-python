# Test-Driven Development with Python

This project is the result of following along all the hands on exercises from the book Test-Driven Development with Python, by Harry Percival.

Commits should follow roughly the same frequency as recommended by the text, although I may put my own experiments among the proposed solutions.

Feel free to clone the project and get your own hands on the code.
